# Thermal imaging

## Description

Creating an IoT device providing thermal data and images (by using an MLX90642 32x24 InfraRed (IR) array), and realizing a very basic IR camera thru an attached display. 
One obvious UseCase is to make this device a burglar detection / home intrusion system for e.g. a bicycle store room. Another UseCase could be monitoring terrariums and the like.

## Demo Software 

SW V0.28 -> non IoT / OLED display / acoustic burglar detection

SW V0.48 -> IoT (not all necessary files can be uploaded here, in order to build a webserver you need several SDK files which are all over the place); OLED display functions will be removed in subsequent SW-Versions (0.49x)

## Thermal image 

Example visualization of a human upper body, generated by simple Python scripts in addition to a Raspberry Pi camera module image.
SW V0.498 (will not be uploaded in this repository).
