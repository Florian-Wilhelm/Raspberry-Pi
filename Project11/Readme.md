# Thermal imaging

## Description

Creating an IoT device providing thermal data and images (by using MLX90642 32x24 InfraRed (IR) array), and realizing a very basic IR camera thru an attached display. One obvious UseCase is to make this device a burglar detection / home intrusion system for e.g. a bicycle store room. 

## Branches of development 

SW V0.2x -> non IoT / OLED display / acoustic burglar detection

SW V0.4x -> IoT / OLED display (not all files will be uploaded here)

## IoT demo 

Example screenshot, SW V0.48.
