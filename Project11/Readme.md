# Thermal imaging

## Description

Thermal imaging with an MLX90642 32x24 InfraRed (IR) array. 

Prototypes will later be used as a burglar detection, or as a simple endoscope.

## Branches of development 

SW V0.2x -> non IoT / OLED display / acoustic burglar detection

SW V0.4x -> IoT / OLED display
