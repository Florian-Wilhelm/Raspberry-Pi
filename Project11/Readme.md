# Home intrusion detection thru thermal imaging

## Description

Creating a burglar detection / home intrusion system consisting of a 32x24 InfraRed (IR) array and a Raspberry Pi Pico W posing as an IoT device. 

## Test Software (uploaded here)

SW V0.29 -> non IoT / OLED display (60 pixels are displayed)

SW V0.48 -> IoT, the webserver provides sensor data of 60 pixels (note: not all necessary files can be uploaded here, in order to build a webserver you need several SDK files which are all over the place in the Pi file system)

## Prototype Software (not to be uploaded in this repository)

SW 1.0x -> IoT, the webserver provides the complete sensor data that can be rendered as one sees fit

## Thermal image 

Example visualization of a human upper body. The Python scripts which do that can be found in this repository.
