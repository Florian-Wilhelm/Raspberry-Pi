# Home intrusion detection by thermal imaging

## Description

Creating a burglar detection / home intrusion system consisting of a 32x24 InfraRed (IR) array and a Raspberry Pi Pico W posing as an IoT device. 

## Demo Software (uploaded here)

SW V0.28 -> non IoT / OLED display

SW V0.48 -> IoT (note: not all necessary files can be uploaded here, in order to build a webserver you need several SDK files which are all over the place in the Pi file system)

## "Production level" Software (not to be uploaded in this repository)

SW V0.49x / 1.0x -> IoT, rudimentary display functions remain; the webserver provides all sensor data that can be rendered as one sees fit 

## Thermal image 

Example visualization of a human upper body. The Python scripts which do that can be found in this repository.
