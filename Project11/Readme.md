# Thermal imaging

## Description

Thermal imaging with an MLX90642 32x24 InfraRed (IR) array. 

Monochrome OLED display is connected for presentation purposes, later prototypes are to be embedded in an IoT environment (for burglar detection and the like).

## Branches of development 

SW V0.2x -> non IoT / OLED display / acoustic burglar detection

SW V0.4x -> IoT / OLED display
