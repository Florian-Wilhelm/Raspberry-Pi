GPS data on a mountain in Bavaria, Pico and GPS module get supplied by a power bank.

Note 1: script is saved as "main.py", so it starts automatically.

Note 2: black bars only appear on the photos, not on the OLED itself; DSLR and mobile phone cam have both CMOS sensors which have a problem with the OLED resfresh rates obviously.
