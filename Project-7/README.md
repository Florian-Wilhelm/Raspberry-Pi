# 6bit R-2R ladder DAC connected to MCP23016 I/O expansion for I2C bus

## Description

A fifty-year old Digital-Analog-Converter (DAC) design with two CD4007 CMOS ICs, but still good enough to get a grasp how these devices work.

Input can be provided by e.g. an MCP23016 or MCP23017 I/O expansion, as it is the case here.
