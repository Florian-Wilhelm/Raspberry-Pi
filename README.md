This is for now just a random collection of Python and MicroPython code examples for the Raspberry Pi and the Raspberry Pi Pico (plus some shell scripts).

Comments and names of variables etc. will be partially in German. Sorry for that :-).

Sidenote: I am not really a skilled coder (my background is mechanical engineering), so the code examples may look bulky or awkward. Focus was on readability, not on creating the shortest possible script.

Feel free to improve and experiment, if you choose to use these code examples.
