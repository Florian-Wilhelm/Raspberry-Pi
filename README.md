This is for now just a random collection of code examples for the Raspberry Pi and the Raspberry Pi Pico.

Comments and names of variables etc. will be partially in German. Sorry for that :-).

Sidenote: I am not really a skilled coder, so the code examples may look bulky or awkward.

Feel free to improve and experiment, if you choose to use these code examples.
