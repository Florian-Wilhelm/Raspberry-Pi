## About

The folders contain a collection of Python and MicroPython code examples for Raspberry Pi and Raspberry Pi Pico projects (plus an extra folder with shell scripts intended for convenience). Compiled code such as .uf2-files is occasionally added for Pico projects.

Comments and names of variables etc. will be partially in German. Sorry for that :-).

Note: I am not really a skilled coder (my background is mechanical engineering), so some of the scripts may be on the whole a bit bulky. Focus was on readability (and I hope the scripts, which are of course tried&tested, are comprehensible), not on creating the least theoretically possible lines of code.
