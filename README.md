### About

The project-folders contain a collection of Python and MicroPython code examples for the Raspberry Pi and the Raspberry Pi Pico (plus an extra folder with shell scripts intended for convenience). 

Comments and names of variables etc. will be partially in German. Sorry for that :-).

Note: I am not really a skilled coder (my background is mechanical engineering), so some of the scripts may be on the whole a bit bulky. Focus was on readability (and I hope the scripts are comprehensible), not on creating the least theoretically possible lines of code.
