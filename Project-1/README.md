## Description

With this plant irrigation system, I am able to take care of my plants via Smartphone even when I am far away from home.

The heart of the configuration is a Raspberry Pi with implemented VPN-Server, so access to the GPIO ports is easy. By means of the SSH-Shell I run Python scripts and activate a 12V water pump thru additional DIY electronics. Full automation would also be possible.

Moisture sensors and the Pi camera provide information about the condition of the plants.

## Experimental configuration

This project leaves plenty of room for experimentation and further improvements.
