## Description

I am able to take care of my vegetables and plants via Smartphone with this irrigation system.

Access to the GPIO ports is easy with an implemented VPN-Server on the Raspberry Pi. By means of the SSH-Shell I'll run Python scripts (to be found in this repo) and activate a 12V water pump thru additional DIY electronics. Full automation (no manual intervention) would be possible as well.

Moisture sensors and the Pi camera provide information about the condition of the plants.

## Experimental configuration

There is plenty of room for experimentation and further improvements, I barely scratched the surface so far.
