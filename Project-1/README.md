# Plant irrigation system

## Description

I am able to take care of my plants via Smartphone with this simple irrigation system.

Access to the GPIO ports is easy thru an implemented VPN-Server on the Raspberry Pi. By means of the SSH-Shell I'll run Python scripts (to be found in this repo) and activate a 12V water pump. Full automation (no manual intervention) would be possible as well.

Moisture sensors and the Pi camera provide information about the condition of the plants. See my hackaday.io project page for more information.
